Hi 👋, I’m Jiashun.

🧪 MosaicX — an automated pipeline for modeling and optimizing physical & dynamical systems from physical models and experimental data.

🧠 LLM reasoning plugins — logic-oriented extensions that enhance inference, verification, and automated decision-making.

🌐 Trustworthy OWL DL knowledge graphs — semantic infrastructures for reliable, explainable scientific workflows.

🎯 All these efforts aim toward the broader vision of a Machine Scientist.

📦 I also share open-source packages and cookbooks to support reproducible research and community learning.

🎓 Preparing for a PhD, focusing on physics-informed computation, reasoning, and automation.
