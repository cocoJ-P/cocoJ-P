Hi 👋, I’m Jiashun.

🧪 **MosaicX** — an automated pipeline for modeling and optimizing physical & dynamical systems from physical models and experimental data. It extends concepts from **DDDA**, a project I co-developed with my supervisor.

🧠 **LLM reasoning plugins** — logic-oriented extensions that enhance inference, verification, and automated decision-making.

🌐 **Trustworthy OWL DL ontologies** — the foundation for building reliable, explainable scientific knowledge graphs and workflows.

🎯 All these efforts aim toward the broader vision of a Machine Scientist.

📦 I also share open-source packages and cookbooks to support reproducible research and community learning.

🎓 Preparing for a PhD, focusing on physics-informed modeling, trustworthy semantic knowledge graphs (OWL DL), and explainable reasoning for scientific discovery.
